percentage X-ray structures that are protein

```
Q1 percentage structures soslved by NMR structures and x-ray
```{r}
csv_protein$Proteins[2]/sum(csv_protein[2,])
```
percentage sreucture solved by NMR
```{r}
nstr <- sum(csv_protein$Total)

percentage <- round(csv_protein$Total*100 / nstr,2)
percentage
#csv_protein[]/sum(csv_protein$Proteins)

```
A1: there are `r percent[1]` X-ray structures and 

?????pdb the first is not N: they are all CA
